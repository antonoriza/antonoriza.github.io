This could fundamentally reshape economic landscapes, with existing economic agents potentially being readjusted and/or new ones emerging, regardless of whether these agents are human or intelligent machines, having market dynamics operations mainly based on the relationships and interactions between the resource allocation agents and not solely on traditional scarcity. Even in a post-scarcity scenario, some limitations might exist, requiring efficient allocation mechanisms dictated by social agreements/rules rather than physical/natural constraints.</p><p>The digital entertainment industry exemplifies the potential impact of technological advancements on resource scarcity. Before the internet and streaming platforms, consumers were limited by broadcasting companies and physical media. They could only access content broadcasted at specific times or purchased as CDs or DVDs. However, the rise of digital entertainment shattered these constraints. New economic agents, like digital creators, influencers, and streaming platforms, emerged alongside advertisers. This disrupted the old system dominated by broadcasters and studios. Content production, consumption, and distribution have been fundamentally reshaped, leading to entirely new interactions between these new players.</p><h2 id=the-soul-of-economics>The Soul of economics</h2><p>Economics serves as a crucial tool for navigating the complexities of our social system, particularly in the face of resource scarcity and ever-expanding human desires. We can say the soul of economics is to explain how we manage to build a civilization that elevates us so far above the knowledge, consumption and energy levels of the base environment of the earth, serving as the scaffolding upon which civilizations ascend beyond the confines of the natural world, guiding humanity towards the zenith of development paving a prosperous future.</p><p>Now, being less poetic, economics is about managing limited resources to meet our seemingly limitless needs, developing ways to promote human development for a more prosperous future.</p><p>Examining historical social systems can be good idea, for example feudalism offers valuable insights into how economies have evolved. Feudalism functioned through a relatively straightforward system characterized by self-sufficient manors, each producing a substantial portion of its own goods and services. Trade did exist, but on a limited scale, often involving specialized regions that provided specific resources or goods needed for overall production.</p><p>In contrast, capitalist economies operate with a highly distributed production system. Production is no longer concentrated in individual manors but rather dispersed across a vast network of businesses and individuals. Similarly, income is also distributed – wages, salaries, profits, and investments flow throughout the system, creating a complex system of interdependencies.</p><p>Understanding this intricate network of production and distribution within a capitalist system presents a significant challenge. The sheer number of actors involved, the variety of goods and services produced, and the constant flow of resources and income make it far more complex than the self-contained model of feudalism.</p></div><div class=post-footer id=post-footer><div class=post-info><div class=post-info-line><div class=post-info-mod><span>Updated on 2024-03-10</span></div></div><div class=post-info-line><div class=post-info-md></div><div class=post-info-share><span><a href=javascript:void(0); title="Share on Twitter" data-sharer=twitter data-url=https://www.antonoriza.com/exploring-economics-the-purpose-of-economics/ data-title="Exploring Economics: The purpose of economics"><i class="fab fa-twitter fa-fw" aria-hidden=true></i></a><a href=javascript:void(0); title="Share on WhatsApp" data-sharer=whatsapp data-url=https://www.antonoriza.com/exploring-economics-the-purpose-of-economics/ data-title="Exploring Economics: The purpose of economics" data-web><i class="fab fa-whatsapp fa-fw" aria-hidden=true></i></a><a href=javascript:void(0); title="Share on Hacker News" data-sharer=hackernews data-url=https://www.antonoriza.com/exploring-economics-the-purpose-of-economics/ data-title="Exploring Economics: The purpose of economics"><i class="fab fa-hacker-news fa-fw" aria-hidden=true></i></a><a href=javascript:void(0); title="Share on Reddit" data-sharer=reddit data-url=https://www.antonoriza.com/exploring-economics-the-purpose-of-economics/><i class="fab fa-reddit fa-fw" aria-hidden=true></i></a></span></div></div></div><div class=post-info-more><section class=post-tags></section><section><span><a href=javascript:void(0); onclick=window.history.back()>Back</a></span>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<span><a href=/>Home</a></span></section></div><div class=post-nav><a href=/tech-stack-powering-this-website/ class=prev rel=prev title="The tech stack powering this website"><i class="fas fa-angle-left fa-fw" aria-hidden=true></i>The tech stack powering this website</a></div></div></article></div></main><footer class=footer><div class=footer-container><div class=footer-line itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/CreativeWork><i class="far fa-copyright fa-fw" aria-hidden=true></i><span itemprop=copyrightYear>2023 - 2024</span><span class=author itemprop=copyrightHolder>&nbsp;<a href=/ target=_blank>Juan Antonio Oriza Armas</a></span>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<span class=license><a rel="license external nofollow noopener noreffer" href=https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/ target=_blank>CC BY-NC 4.0</a></span></div></div></footer></div><div id=fixed-buttons><a href=# id=back-to-top class=fixed-button title="Back to Top"><i class="fas fa-arrow-up fa-fw" aria-hidden=true></i>
