[{"categories":null,"content":"I have been curious about starting or not a blog. There are a lot of texts out there that already share good insights around different topics of my interest, so why should I repeat the same information? I think there are a lot of things out there waiting to be told in a fresh and wild way. Ideas are like a never ending feedback loop, continually being recycled and repurposed throughout the world. An idea cannot be expected to be novel to all individuals, rather it’s a remix from the previous ones and in the same way it becomes a foundation for future ones. It’s not about the originality of your idea, it’s about its value and impact. If your idea is innovative to the people who read it, that’s enough. The most influential programmers I know have an emphasis and encourage the written word. In fact, writing is very much like coding. For example, sometimes ideas can feel clear and complete but It’s only when you try to put them into code that you discover they’re not, and in a similar way when you attempt to write about a topic you thought you knew well, you may realize that your understanding of it was not as deep as you had previously believed. The act of writing ideas down before starting to write/code is inseparable from the creation process, both involve iterative steps, refinements and clear thinking. Writing is an incredible way to explore and discover connections between different ideas. Also the skills you develop in both areas are highly transferable, and anyone who wants to excel in one area can benefit from working on the other. Current communication channels allow us to write every random thought to any audience on the internet. Twitter is a great way to share thoughts and get feedback from anyone in the world. On the other hand, I find blogs as a more personal and funny way to share ideas. I may use Twitter as a way to write simple random thoughts and if it’s the case develop those thoughts deeper here. A few years ago I used to write brief articles for my university official blog. Usually those articles were high level descriptions around technological topics using ordinary words and simple sentences. When I made a mistake, it was easier to understand using simple terms rather than using fancy words. Fancy writing conceals ideas and it’s a way to hide the fact the authors have nothing to say, whereas writing simply keeps you honest and helps to develop a clean thinking analysis around a subject. At the end, If you say nothing simply it will be obvious to everyone including you, and at the same time the easier something is to read, the more deeply readers will engage with it. It’s a win-win for both sides, the writer and the audience. This blog will be my personal space to develop my writing skills and my systematic thinking to explore ideas, find new connections and understand topics of my interest from a less knowledgeable perspective. Nothing here will be completely analyzed and thus finished, as ideas get transformed through the time I will be updating the content of some posts based on new findings or reflections. It’s my repository of random ideas, I hope you enjoy some posts here.
