[{"categories":null,"content":"Shortly after I finished High school, I had decided to take 1 year to focus entirely on my entrepreneurial journey before university. I was lucky to be participating in a really good French incubator program led by two great economists in Mexico City. My interactions with them made me ask myself if I wanted to follow the engineering or the economics path. I clearly choosed the engineering path after evaluating how my strengths and situation at that time could optimize to generate the most impact in my goals. Now the scope of my goals has grown, and thus the knowledge that I need to complete them too. Hopefully, a lot of the needed knowledge seems to hold on to “economics,” Some time ago i heard one of my mentors said “engineers are good fixing problems but bad at finding them”. In the realm of entrepreneurship and business, understanding economics is an essential pillar of success, providing a conceptual framework to analyze how value is created, exchanged, and distributed within a society. This knowledge equips entrepreneurs with the tools to navigate complexities, seize opportunities, and create enduring value in the ever-evolving landscape of business and innovation. In this sense, will be sharing part of my notes in this post series. With that said… leeeeets go!

Wikipedia gives us this perfect definition: Quote «Economics focuses on the behavior and interactions of economic agents and how economies work» Investopedia gives this definition: Quote «Economics is a social science that focuses on the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services» The University of Buffalo says: Quote «Economics is the study of scarcity and its implications for the use of resources, production of goods and services, growth of production and welfare over time, and a great variety of other complex issues of vital concern to society» If we try to summarize previous definitions into one we could say: Quote «Economics examines the behavior and interactions of economic agents, focusing on the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services in the context of scarcity» OK, notice these keywords from our previous definition are needed to have economics: “Economics agents”: Entities engaged in economic activity (buying, selling, production, distribution, consumption, resource management, influencing capital). “Scarcity”: Denote the relative availability of production inputs or the decrease in the supply of a resource or product relative to demand over time. Let’s conduct a binary permutation analysis using scarcity and economic agents as key variables to assess their impact on market dynamics and economic relevance through the logical technique of Reductio ad absurdum: EconomicAgents Scarcity Result 0 0 Zero market dynamics occurs. Economics becomes irrelevant. Resources are abundant. 0 1 Zero market dynamics occurs. Economics becomes irrelevant. Scarcity becomes a useless concept. 1 0 Market dynamics occurs. Economic agents have no constraints on resources. No need for allocation or distribution of resources. 1 1 Current economics. The 3rd permutation (10) highlights an interesting behavior in market dynamics and shows the opportunity of a potential disruption in markets transitioning into that phase: the shift in power dynamics governing resource allocation (either centralized or decentralized) can lead to the emergence of new economic agents, new forms of interaction, and ultimately, the creation of entirely new sub-markets branching off from the original one. For example, the current wave of technological advancements – like digitalization, automation, and AI – has the potential to catalyze an era of post-scarcity for many industries. This could fundamentally reshape economic landscapes, with existing economic agents potentially being readjusted and/or new ones emerging, regardless of whether these agents are human or intelligent machines, having market dynamics operations mainly based on the relationships and interactions between the resource allocation agents and not solely on traditional scarcity. Even in a post-scarcity scenario, some limitations might exist, requiring efficient allocation mechanisms dictated by social agreements/rules rather than physical/natural constraints. The digital entertainment industry exemplifies the potential impact of technological advancements on resource scarcity. Before the internet and streaming platforms, consumers were limited by broadcasting companies and physical media. They could only access content broadcasted at specific times or purchased as CDs or DVDs. However, the rise of digital entertainment shattered these constraints. New economic agents, like digital creators, influencers, and streaming platforms, emerged alongside advertisers. This disrupted the old system dominated by broadcasters and studios. Content production, consumption, and distribution have been fundamentally reshaped, leading to entirely new interactions between these new players.

We can say the soul of economics is to guide us to build a civilization that elevates us so far above the knowledge, consumption and energy levels of the base environment of the earth, serving as the scaffolding upon which civilizations ascend beyond the confines of the natural world, guiding humanity towards the zenith of development paving a prosperous future. Examining historical economic systems can provide valuable insights into how economies have evolved over time. For example, feudalism offers a glimpse into a relatively straightforward system characterized by self-sufficient manors, each producing a substantial portion of its own goods and services. Trade existed, but on a limited scale, often involving specialized regions that provided specific resources or goods needed for overall production. In contrast, capitalist economies operate with a highly distributed production system. Production is no longer concentrated in individual manors but rather dispersed across a vast network of businesses and individuals. Similarly, income is also distributed – wages, salaries, profits, and investments flow throughout the system, creating a complex web of interdependencies. The shift around the network of production and distribution within a capitalist system versus feudalism represents a significative change, ranging from the number of actors involved, the variety of goods and services produced, and the constant flow of resources and income… making it far more complex than the self-contained model of feudalism by allowing greater resource allocation, production and meeting of human needs/desires and thus requiring a deeper understanding of economic principles and dynamics.

It’s like the operating system of an economy, guiding how resources are allocated and decisions are made. There are various types of economic systems, each with its own set of rules, incentives, and outcomes. Let’s break down them: Hunter-Gatherer Economy: This was the earliest economic system based on hunting wild animals and gathering edible plants/foods. There was little to no concept of ownership or property rights. Nomadic groups constantly moved to find new food sources. No permanent settlements or shelters. Economic activities were hunting, fishing, foraging. Very little surplus production or trade beyond the local tribe/group. Egalitarian social structure with no social stratification. Pastoral Economy: This emerged with the domestication of animals like cattle, sheep, etc. Pastoral societies were nomadic, basing their economy on herding domesticated livestock. Followed seasonal grazing patterns for herds. Use of portable tents/shelters rather than permanent settlements. Economic activities centered around animal husbandry. Some barter trade of animals and animal products. Social hierarchies started to emerge between wealthy herders and others. Subsistence Agriculture: Economy As humans transitioned to settled farming, subsistence agriculture became the economic system where basic crops/foods were produced to meet the needs of the local population. Development of first permanent villages and simple farming tools. Main crops were grains like wheat, rice, etc. and some vegetables. Very little surplus or trade beyond village/community needs. Start of food storage techniques like granaries. More divisions of labor within communities. Slave Economy: Prominent in ancient societies like Greece, Rome, and parts of Africa/Americas. The main economic activities relied on slave labor owned by elite classes. Slaves seen as human property with no rights, freedoms or pay. Allow concentration of labor for large projects and plantations. Trade emerged to facilitate movement of slaves between regions. Economic output determined by sizes of slave labor forces. Stark divide between aristocratic slave-owners and enslaved masses. Feudalism: The predominant economic system in medieval Europe based on self-sufficient agricultural estates called manors controlled by nobility. Manors had a strict hierarchical system of lords, vassals and peasant serfs. Serfs were bound to land and required to labor on the lord’s fields. Lords granted fiefs/land to vassals in exchange for military service. Very limited trade between manors except for specialized goods. Social status based strictly on birthright rather than capital ownership. Mercantilism: This was a pre-capitalist economic policy pursued by European nation-states from the 16th-18th centuries. Aimed to promote national economic self-sufficiency and exports. Use of protectionist policies like tariffs and import bans. State-granted monopolies to companies engaged in foreign trade. Colonization of new territories to secure sources of raw materials. Economic development tied to accumulation of gold/bullion reserves. Capitalism: A market-based economic system with private ownership of capital and property rights as the core principles. Economic decisions driven by the pursuit of profit in free markets. Emergence of wage labor, where people sell their labor for compensation. Encourages entrepreneurship, innovation and economic growth. Capital accumulation through reinvestment of profits into more production. High levels of trade, investment flows across national/global markets. Social mobility possible through acquisition of capital and wealth. Socialism: This economic system advocates for social ownership and administration of the means of production.Central planning by the state ","date":"2024-03-10","objectID":"/exploring-economics-the-purpose-of-economics/:3:0","tags":null,"title":"Exploring Economics: The purpose of economics","uri":"/exploring-economics-the-purpose-of-economics/"},{"categories":null,"content":"Hey there! If you know me through my side job related to building websites, you might assume this website is built with WordPress. But nope! On my journey to becoming a writer, I wanted to learn something new (WordPress had become too easy for me) and experience the magical feeling that comes with learning and creating something new. To be honest, my hacker mind initially thought, “Let’s build a blog from scratch using an esoteric programming language, create a solid framework, release it as open source to the public, and finally, build the blog on top of it.” From another perspective I also considered some great options that focus on the writing experience, such as Bearblog, Substack, and Medium. After swinging between extremes, from the “full developer experience” to the “full writer experience,” it was time to find equilibrium between both and choose the best way to create a blog. So, I started exploring popular stacks and frameworks available. Among the many stacks available (like MEAN, MEARN, LAMP, Django, Ruby on Rails, LAMP), I wanted to choose something “powerful.” This was clearly a subjective matter so I made a list of characteristics I wanted on my website (big-picture requirements, if they can be termed as such): A blog An “about me” page A minimalistic view Social media icons Built-in support for multilingual pages Fast loading pages Mobile responsiveness Easy maintenance and scalability A custom domain No need to pay for hosting It’s clear that what I had in mind was simple (just static content, no databases, no fancy backend). So, why would I want to use a “powerful” stack? It would be over engineering! I can easily create a simple project using HTML and CSS (or even use a pure HTML, CSS template), and that’s it! This brings up an interesting point. If you are an engineer/maker/developer, you might agree that we became engineers/makers/developers because we enjoy building things and solving complex problems. Sometimes, it’s exciting to imagine a complex solution to a problem pursuing the “ultimate solution to all cases related to it”. However, besides I’m skeptical that an “ultimate solution to all cases” exists for a problem, it is really common to see people getting lost in the problem, losing focus on other important parameters, such as time available, feasibility, and complexity… and paradoxically that creates a more important a problem because you disconnect from the impactful solution and the outcomes of the thing you work on. Creating and delivering something can become an interesting or a Sisyphean activity. At the end you as a maker/creator must find fulfillment in the act of shipping stable iterations of your creation over time in the same way you find it in the act of solving complex issues. So, I had finally made some progress… I had decided to create my blog with pure HTML, CSS and JS. But I was not happy with that choice. While the decision to use pure HTML, CSS, and JS is commendable for the full customization it provides, incorporating a framework could be a better idea and a strategic choice to overcome common development hurdles related with time of developing, group the complexity involved, improve efficiency, and enhance the overall performance of your blog website as it evolves. So, I spent almost two weeks (in my free time) reading all over the web about frameworks until I found an architectural approach called “Jamstack” (JavaScript, APIs, Markdown) which I liked. In layman terms it simplifies the development workflow by decoupling the front-end from the back-end, precompiling/prerendering much of the content before the HTML reaches the browser, creating clean and atomic deployments, serving a website/application statically on the edge. For my plans it seems to provide an interesting mix of authoring \u0026 developer experience. To start writing all you have to do is create a new markdown file in the proper directory and start writing and if you are in developer mode you can add your own custom","date":"2024-01-14","objectID":"/tech-stack-powering-this-website/:0:0","tags":null,"title":"The tech stack powering this website","uri":"/tech-stack-powering-this-website/"},{"categories":null,"content":"The other day while I was scrolling through my LinkedIn feed I read the following quote: Quote «The electric light did not come from the continuous improvement of candles» -Oren Harari This idea is relevant in the process of creating products and services, specifically it exemplifies the “incremental” versus “disruptive” improvement concepts. The term “creation” is clear but in the current world a lot of people just copy/duplicate someone else’s product/service and implement it in their country or region targeting it as “innovation”. This is wrong, and what they are merely doing is taking advantage of one of the economic features of globalization. When you take an existing product/service and make it a little better, it’s an incremental innovation. A lot of companies and organizations tend to use this approach to keep their competitive advantage in the market. It tends to follow a systematic and structured way, minimizing the risks associated with a “disruptive idea”. Incremental innovations often use the “Kaizen” and “PDCA” approach to create small and incremental improvements to products and services on a regular basis, with the goal of gradually improving performance, quality, and efficiency over time. But these incremental improvements follow the idea chain of the active product/service, and the “innovative” output (if it exists) would be a serendipity process. There is one quote from Henry Ford that summarizes this idea: «If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses\". When your product/service radically changes the way people use or consume it, it’s a disruptive innovation. Disruptive products and services typically start small and grow rapidly, eventually displacing established players in the market, and those who don’t accomplish it often don’t tend to be as economic and process efficient as they thought and end up being eaten by others. Being disruptive requires a willingness to take high risks, experiment, and challenge the status quo having the potential to transform industries or create new ones. That is why a lot of startups are seen as the counterculture of classic well established business and bigTechs, they adopt higher risks, move faster and surf the ripple effects of the techno-socio-economic changes around them. None of these approaches is better than the other, they are just different approaches to take when you are creating a product or service and the decision of what you should choose depends on a lot of factors. But there is one thing that lies behind them, the first principles of the stuff you want to improve. If you focus merely on the product/service, what you are going to do is waste all your energy and resources in the abstraction concept of the main problem behind it. But if you zoom out to see the bigger picture, focus on the root issue, understand the capabilities and constraints of why it is done in the way it is currently done, you’ll have a better chance of finding high impact solutions, no matter if it is an incremental or disruptive change.

There are a lot of texts out there that already share good insights and ideas around different topics of my interest, so why should I repeat the same information? But the thing is I believe there are a lot of things out there waiting to be told in a fresh and wild way. When you take a different perspective or approach, you may discover insights that others have missed. This may be contrary to the common belief «there is nothing new under the sun». Of course we can break down ideas into their component parts until we reach the first principles behind it, arguing that all that we know and will know are just permutations and combinations of them. While it has a kernel of truth, it is a hyper-generalization and oversimplification of everything. The concept of ideas as a scarce resource implies that there is a finite amount of creativity or innovation available in the world and there is nothing more wrong than it. Of course an idea cannot be expected to be novel to all individuals and It’s easy to fall into the trap of regurgitating the same ideas and cliches often found in common knowledge and communication channels. That is why I had my doubts about this blog. But ideas live in a perpetual feedback loop where these are being recycled, refined and evolving through time… they are a remix from the previous ones and in the same way they become a foundation for future ones. They are dynamic entities that continually shift and transform, influenced by the experiences and perspectives of those who encounter them. The most impactful ideas are those that take existing ideas and make them accessible or applicable to a wider audience. It’s not about the originality of your idea, it’s about its value and impact. If your idea is innovative to the people who read it, that’s enough. But how do I know if my idea can be innovative to the people? As someone once said «If you can identify a delusional popular belief, you can find what lies hidden behind it: the contrarian truth». This is where innovative ideas and insight lies - in the ability to think differently, question the status quo and take a contrarian approach. Sometimes ideas can feel clear and complete but It’s only when you try to put them into words that you discover they’re no. When we put our thoughts and ideas down on paper, we can see them more clearly and objectively and challenge ourselves to think more deeply and critically about the issues that matter most to us. In this way, writing is an incredible way to explore, discover and organize the connections between different ideas. The most influential programmers I know have an emphasis and encourage the written word. Writing is very much like coding in a lot of aspects. For example, both require the ability to organize complex ideas in a logical way with a coherent structure that is easy to read and understand. Ultimately both involve iterative steps, refinements and clear thinking. This blog will be my personal space to develop my writing skills and my systematic thinking. Here I will organize my thoughts and ideas in a coherent and structured manner, identifying biases and assumptions that may be impeding my ability to think clearly and generate or find new ideas/insights around a topic of my interest. It’s my repository of random ideas, I hope you enjoy some posts here.
