Shortly after I finished High school I had decided to take 1 year to focus entirely on my entrepreneurial journey before university. I was lucky to be participating in a really good french incubator program led by two great economists in Mexico in the heart of Mexico City. My interactions with them made me ask myself if I wanted to follow the engineering or the economics path. 

I clearly choosed the engineering path after evaluating how my  strengths and situation at that time could optimize to generate the most impact in my goals. Now the scope of my goals has grown and thus the knowledge that I need to complete them too. 

Hopefully a  lot of the needed  knowledge seems to hold on to  “economics”, so I will be sharing part of my notes in this post series. With that said… leeeeets go!

## What is “economics”? 

Wikipedia gives us this perfect definition:
{{< admonition quote >}}
*«Economics focuses on the behavior and interactions of economic agents and how economies work»*
{{< /admonition >}}

Investopedia gives this definition:
{{< admonition quote >}}
*«Economics is a social science that focuses on the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services»*
{{< /admonition >}}

The University of Buffalo says:
{{< admonition quote >}}
*«Economics is the study of scarcity and its implications for the use of resources, production of goods and services, growth of production and welfare over time, and a great variety of other complex issues of vital concern to society»*
{{< /admonition >}}

If we try to summarize previous definitions into one we could say:
{{< admonition quote >}}
*«Economics examines the behavior and interactions of economic agents, focusing on the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services in the context of scarcity»*
{{< /admonition >}}

OK, notice these keywords from our previous definition are needed to have economics:

* “Economics agents”: Entities engaged in economic activity (buying, selling, production, distribution, consumption, resource management, influencing capital).
* "Scarcity": Denote the relative availability of production inputs or the decrease in the supply of a resource or product relative to demand over time.

Let's conduct a binary permutation analysis using scarcity and economic agents as key variables to assess their impact on market dynamics and economic relevance through the logical technique of *Reductio ad absurdum*:

| EconomicAgents | Scarcity| Result|
| ------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| 0 | 0 | <li> Zero market dynamics occurs.</li>  <li> Economics becomes irrelevant.</li> <li> Resources are abundant.</li> |
| 0 | 1 | <li> Zero market dynamics occurs.</li>  <li> Economics becomes irrelevant.</li> <li> Scarcity becomes a useless concept.</li> |
| 1 | 0 |  <li>  Market dynamics occurs. </li> <li> Economic agents have no constraints on resources.</li> <li> No need for allocation or distribution of resources.</li> |
| 1 | 1 | <li> Current economics.</li> |

The 3rd permutation (10) highlights an interesting behavior in market dynamics and shows the opportunity of a potential disruption in markets transitioning into that phase: the shift in power dynamics governing resource allocation (either centralized or decentralized) can lead to the emergence of new economic agents, new forms of interaction, and ultimately, the creation of entirely new sub-markets branching off from the original one.

For example, the current wave of technological advancements – like digitalization, automation, and AI – has the potential to catalyze an era of post-scarcity for many industries. This could fundamentally reshape economic landscapes, with existing economic agents potentially being readjusted and/or new ones emerging, regardless of whether these agents are human or intelligent machines, having market dynamics operations mainly based on the relationships and interactions between the resource allocation agents and not solely on traditional scarcity. Even in a post-scarcity scenario, some limitations might exist, requiring efficient allocation mechanisms dictated by social agreements/rules rather than physical/natural constraints.

The digital entertainment industry exemplifies the potential impact of technological advancements on resource scarcity. Before the internet and streaming platforms, consumers were limited by broadcasting companies and physical media.  They could only access content broadcasted at specific times or purchased as CDs or DVDs. However, the rise of digital entertainment shattered these constraints. New economic agents, like digital creators, influencers, and streaming platforms, emerged alongside advertisers. This disrupted the old system dominated by broadcasters and studios.  Content production, consumption, and distribution have been fundamentally reshaped, leading to entirely new interactions between these new players.

## The Soul of economics

Economics serves as a crucial tool for navigating the complexities of our social system, particularly in the face of resource scarcity and ever-expanding human desires. We can say the soul of economics is to explain how we manage to build a civilization that elevates us so far above the knowledge, consumption and energy levels of the base environment of the earth, serving as the scaffolding upon which civilizations ascend beyond the confines of the natural world, guiding humanity towards the zenith of development paving a prosperous future. 

Now, being less poetic, economics is about managing limited resources to meet our seemingly limitless needs, developing ways to promote human development for a more prosperous future.

Examining historical social systems can be good idea, for example feudalism offers valuable insights into how economies have evolved. Feudalism functioned through a relatively straightforward system characterized by self-sufficient manors, each producing a substantial portion of its own goods and services. Trade did exist, but on a limited scale, often involving specialized regions that provided specific resources or goods needed for overall production.

In contrast, capitalist economies operate with a highly distributed production system. Production is no longer concentrated in individual manors but rather dispersed across a vast network of businesses and individuals. Similarly, income is also distributed – wages, salaries, profits, and investments flow throughout the system, creating a complex system of interdependencies.

Understanding this intricate network of production and distribution within a capitalist system presents a significant challenge. The sheer number of actors involved, the variety of goods and services produced, and the constant flow of resources and income make it far more complex than the self-contained model of feudalism.
