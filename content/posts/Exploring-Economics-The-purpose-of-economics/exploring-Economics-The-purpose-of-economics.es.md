Shortly after I finished High school I had decided to take 1 year to focus entirely on my entrepreneurial journey before university. I was lucky to be participating in a really good french incubator program led by two great economists in Mexico in the heart of Mexico City. My interactions with them made me ask myself if I wanted to follow the engineering or the economics path. 

I clearly choosed the engineering path after evaluating how my  strengths and situation at that time could optimize to generate the most impact in my goals. Now the scope of my goals has grown and thus the knowledge that I need to complete them too. 

Hopefully a  lot of the needed  knowledge seems to hold on to  “economics”, so I will be sharing part of my notes in this post series. With that said… leeeeets go!

## What is “economics”? 

Wikipedia gives us this perfect definition:
{{< admonition quote >}}
*«Economics focuses on the behavior and interactions of economic agents and how economies work»*
{{< /admonition >}}

Investopedia gives this definition:
{{< admonition quote >}}
*«Economics is a social science that focuses on the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services»*
{{< /admonition >}}

The University of Buffalo says:
{{< admonition quote >}}
*«Economics is the study of scarcity and its implications for the use of resources, production of goods and services, growth of production and welfare over time, and a great variety of other complex issues of vital concern to society»*
{{< /admonition >}}

If we try to summarize previous definitions into one we could say:
{{< admonition quote >}}
*«Economics examines the behavior and interactions of economic agents, focusing on the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services in the context of scarcity»*
{{< /admonition >}}

OK, notice these keywords from our previous definition are needed to have economics:

* “Economics agents”: Entities engaged in economic activity (buying, selling, production, distribution, consumption, resource management, influencing capital).
* "Scarcity": Denote the relative availability of production inputs or the decrease in the supply of a resource or product relative to demand over time.

Let's try a quick logical technique “Reductio ad absurdum” to analyze the importance of previous keywords: 

<ol type="A">
  <li> In a world without economic agents, and without scarcity --> Economics is definitely not needed.</li>
  <li> In a world without economic agents but scarcity --> Scarcity is not needed.</li>
  <li> In a world with economics agents but without scarcity --> Economics agents are not needed.</li>
</ol>

Case “C” is interesting, it can help us to create/discover new markets or create/discover markets in risk of disappearing. I believe current technological changes (Digitalization, Automation, AI) will lead us to a post-scarcity scenario in a lot of industries, destroying active economics agents ruling that market and forcing the creation of new ones under a centralized or decentralized way… no matter if it is performed by humans or another “intelligent” agent.

In this sense, economics will always be needed. But why do we need the concept of economy? Well, we as humans need it to develop, maintain and grow a civilization that transcends the natural limitations of knowledge, environment and energy consumption.
