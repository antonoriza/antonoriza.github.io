I have been curious about starting or not a blog. There are a lot of texts out there that already share good insights around different topics of my interest, so why should I repeat the same information? I think there are a lot of things out there waiting to be told in a fresh and wild way.

The most influential programmers I know have an emphasis and encourage the written word. In fact, writing is very much like coding, the act of writing ideas down before starting to code is inseparable from the creation process, both involve iterative steps, refinements and clear thinking.

Sometimes Ideas can feel clear and complete. It's only when you try to put them into words that you discover they're not. When you face yourself to write ideas around a specific topic you think you know well, it usually shows you that you didn't know it as well as you thought. 

A few years ago I used to write brief articles for my university official blog. Usually those articles were high level descriptions around  technological topics using ordinary words and simple sentences. I loved it, that kind of writing is easier to read, and the easier something is to read, the more deeply readers will engage with it.

But writing is not only about sharing ideas to an audience, it's also about  exploring and discovering new ones.

One of the challenges to accomplish this is “fancy writing”. This kind of writing conceals ideas and it's a way to hide the fact the authors have nothing to say. Whereas writing simply keeps you honest and helps to develop a clean thinking analysis around a subject. At the end, If you say nothing simply, it will be obvious to everyone, including you. This is one of the benefits of writing to an audience instead of keeping your writings just for yourself. 

Current communication channels allow us to write every random thought to any audience on the internet. Twitter is a great way to share thoughts and get feedback from anyone in the world. On the other hand, I find blogs as a more personal and funny way to share ideas. I may use Twitter as a way to write simple random thoughts and if it's the case develop those  thoughts deeper here.

I no longer plan to write articles like the ones I wrote some years ago for my University Blog, instead I will be writing vague ideas that often come to mind with the objective to reflect around them and be able to clarify and understand them in ways that allow me to generate new findings about the topic, keeping a simple and clear language. I will call it my personal random thoughts repository.
